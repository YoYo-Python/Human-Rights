        <p>
            Common liberties are privileges we have essentially on the grounds that we exist as people - they are not conceded by
            any state. These all inclusive freedoms are intrinsic to all of us, paying little mind to identity, sex, public or
            ethnic beginning, shading, religion, language, or some other status. They range from the most principal - the right to
            life - to those that make daily routine worth experiencing, like the freedoms to food, training, work, wellbeing, and
            freedom.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR), took on by the UN General Assembly in 1948, was the main authoritative
            archive to set out the basic common freedoms to be all around secured. The UDHR, which turned 70 out of 2018, keeps on
            being the establishment of all global basic freedoms law. Its 30 articles give the standards and building squares of
            current and future common freedoms shows, deals and other legitimate instruments.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            The UDHR, along with the 2 agreements - the International Covenant for Civil and Political Rights, and the International
            Covenant for Economic, Social and Cultural Rights - make up the International Bill of Rights.
        </p>
        <p>
            The rule of all inclusiveness of basic freedoms is the foundation of worldwide common liberties law. This implies that
            we are for the most part similarly qualified for our basic freedoms. This rule, as first underlined in the UDHR, is
            rehashed in numerous worldwide common freedoms shows, assertions, and goals.
        </p>
        <h2 id="agreements">Agreements</h2>
        <p>
            UNICEF/HQ04-0734/Jim Holmes shows all basic liberties that are unified and relied on. This implies that one bunch of freedoms can't be
            delighted in completely without the other. For instance, gaining ground in common and political freedoms makes it
            simpler to practice financial, political and social privileges. Essentially, disregarding privileges can contrarily influence numerous different freedoms.

        <h2>DIGNITY</h2>
        <p>
            At its most basic, the concept of human dignity is the belief that all people hold a special value that’s tied solely to
            their humanity. It has nothing to do with their class, race, gender, religion, abilities, or any other factor other than
            them being human.
            <br>
            <br>
            
            The term “dignity” has evolved over the years. Originally, the Latin, English, and French words for “dignity” did not
            have anything to do with a person’s inherent value. It aligned much closer with someone’s “merit.” If someone was
            “dignified,” it meant they had a high status. They belonged to royalty or the church, or, at the very least, they had
            money. For this reason, “human dignity” does not appear in the US Declaration of Independence or the Constitution. The
            phrase as we understand it today wasn’t recognized until 1948. The United Nations ratified the Universal Declaration of
            Human Rights.

    <div id="respect">
        <h2>RESPECT</h2>
        <p>
            Respect is an overarching consideration and represents recognition of each human being’s intrinsic value. As such,
            making opportunity for human beings to exercise autonomy and make their own decisions is paramount, as is a commitment
            to participant welfare over and above research goals. Respect requires prior knowledge of and due regard for culture,
            values, customs, beliefs and practices, both individual and collective, of those involved in research. It also requires
            mindfulness of differences in values and culture between researchers and participants, thus avoiding ‘difference
            blindness’ which can undermine both trustful relationships as well as research integrity.
            It involves of honoring and accepting a person in society.

        <h2>EQUALITY</h2>
        <p>
            Equality and non-discrimination means that all individuals are equal as human beings and by virtue of the inherent dignity of each human person. All human beings
            are entitled to their human rights without discrimination of any kind, such as race, color, sex, ethnicity, age,
            language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, disability, property, birth or other status
            as explained by the human rights treaty bodies.

    <h2>FAIRNESS</h2>
    <p>
        Fairness is important. It takes place in all our lives. If we did not have
        fairness our lives would be crazy. Fairness is when everyone is treated equally and
        no one is left out. People that are fair follow the rules in sports, games, activities,
        and in their community. They are honest and trustworthy. They follow Eleanor
        Roosevelt’s quote “It is not fair to ask of others what you are unwilling to do
        yourself.”
        <br>
        <br>
        Fairness is very important in a community. Everyone needs to follow the
        rules, be respectful of one another and work together to build a strong and beautiful
        community. They can do this by getting together in a friendly way to solve
        problems and make rules that are fair to everyone.
